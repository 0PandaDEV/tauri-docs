## Previewing API References

If you'd like to view the API references locally then there are a few extra steps:

1. Initialize the submodules with `git submodule update --init`
2. Prepare the submodules by running `pnpm dev:setup`

Now you should have the `http://localhost:3000/2/reference/` routes available for preview.
