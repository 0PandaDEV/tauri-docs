import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

One of the things that makes Tauri so flexible is it's ability to work with virtually any frontend framework. We've created the [`create-tauri-app`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/create-tauri-app) utility to help you a new Tauri project using any of the officially supported frameworks.

To get started using `create-tauri-app` run one of the following commands:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Bash">
```sh
sh <(curl https://create.tauri.app/sh)
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="PowerShell">
```powershell
irm https://create.tauri.app/ps | iex
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Cargo">
```sh
cargo install create-tauri-app
cargo create-tauri-app
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="npm">
```sh
npm create tauri-app@latest
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="yarn">
```sh
yarn create tauri-app
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">
```sh
pnpm create tauri-app
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip[Not sure which to choose?]
If you're not sure which of the above to choose we recommend using Bash on Linux and macOS or PowerShell on Windows.
